# nest
Nest is a tiny PHP MVC framework for monolithic web applications. Thought for bootstraping simple projects as fast as possible so they can fly.

## Installation
To install your nest application, just download this repository.
Then change the dummy information on "/app/config/config.php" and you're all set.

## About
Nest is a microframework (< 10kb unziped) for simple CRUD operations and plain PHP logic without any dependencies.
It follows a MVC structure, so if you are used to more complex frameworks it should feel very incomplete.
However, it can be a good starting point for people that are getting a grip on OOPHP and the MVC pattern as it is very descriptive and intuitive.

Also, I kept a optional structure on the Views directory for the pages (contrasting with other types of pages, such as blog posts).
It's all on the files.

Happy Coding!
